## Prior Work

This document contains a list of links and pointers to other efforts going on in this space.

Feel free to add below!

* Keybase.io had a service to verify identities for social media and send encrypted messages.
  The original system and open source command line program allowed you to get a public key safely, just by knowing a person's username on a social network.
* [Debian](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianDeveloper/JoinTheProject/NewMember#Step_4:_Identification) generally requires identity verification of maintainers/developers.
  Pseudonymous contributions are only allowed in special circumstances.
* [Fedora](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Join_the_package_collection_maintainers#Introduce_yourself) prefers/requires real name communication for maintainers, but doesn't attempt to require it.
* [Ubuntu](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NewDevelopersAndMaintainers) doesn't enforce identity, but worries about it: "Authentication problem, you have to know that a person is who he says he is."
* [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/community-membership.md) requires existing members to sponsor new members.
* [Linux Kernel/Hyperledger Discussion re: DCOs](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/plugins/servlet/mobile?contentId=24775311#content/view/24775311)
"In the Linux kernel for example the maintainers are expected to know the identity of anyone whose patches they're contributing.
The real issue is if there was ever a legal matter, would the person be identifiable and available because we have their identity."
